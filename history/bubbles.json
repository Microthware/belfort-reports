You may SELL or HOLD existing positions, and you may BUY new ones only if AVAILABLE_CASH_USD is sufficient. NEVER spend more than AVAILABLE_CASH_USD and NEVER sell more than currently held (FIFO).\n\n- You MUST output at least one action for the current day (first run included). Prefer buys from CANDIDATES_TODAY. If truly nothing qualifies, emit a single HOLD with 'balance_after'.\n\n- Allocate ~100% of capital across 1\u20134 positions using PRICES_TODAY (USD). Buys may be fractional shares (qty can be decimal, \u2265 4 places). For each buy, you may decide a dollar allocation and compute qty = allocation_dollars / price.\n\n- For EVERY action you output (buy/sell/hold/rebalance), include 'balance_after' = total portfolio value immediately after that action (cash + positions), valued using PRICES_TODAY.\n\n- For SELL actions, compute 'pnl_pct' from FIFO cost of prior BUYS when possible; keep it numeric (e.g., 0.0123 for +1.23), or null if not computable.\n\n- Keep numbers raw (no % signs in 'pnl_pct').\n\n- End-of-day you may hold 1\u20134 positions or cash if no setups qualify.
